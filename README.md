## My process

#### Backend
1. Defined Models with Data Annotations and created DbContext using Entity Framework Core with ASP.NET Identity.
2. Ensured that Achievements are created on Database creation.
3. Created DTOs for login, register and reset password purpose.
4. Configured ASP.NET Identity.
5. AuthService implementation to store responsibility for actions like login, logout, registering and password recovery. For now I only implemented methods responsible for login, register and logout. Wondered what these methods should return, so I created ```AuthOperationResult``` class which purpose is to store results of auth operations.
